# Predicting the outcome of Premier League matches

The model defined in this repository uses a dataset of PL fixture history to
train a gradient boosted tree model (LightGBM) that can predict the outcome
of the remaining fixtures in the season for any Premier League team.

All interesting aspects of the model are visualised in the notebook `gbm_main.ipynb`, whilst the data importation and processing modules can be found in the `data` directory.

See the wiki for performance history.
